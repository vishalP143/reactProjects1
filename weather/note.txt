Here's an explanation of your **`GfGWeatherApp`** component:

### Overview:
This React component is a simple weather application that allows users to search for the current weather of any city. It retrieves weather data using the **OpenWeather API** and displays information like the temperature, weather description, and wind speed. The app also handles loading states and errors, such as when the city is not found.

### Key Features:

1. **State Management**:
   - `input`: Stores the name of the city typed by the user in the input field.
   - `weather`: An object that tracks the status of the weather data. It contains three key properties:
     - `loading`: A boolean that shows whether the app is waiting for data from the API.
     - `data`: This stores the weather data retrieved from the API when the search is successful.
     - `error`: A boolean that indicates if there was an error in the API request (e.g., city not found).

2. **Fetching Weather Data (`search` function)**:
   - The app sends an API request to the OpenWeather API when the user presses the "Enter" key.
   - The request includes the city name (`input`), and the temperature is returned in **Celsius**.
   - If the request is successful, the weather data is saved in the `weather` state.
   - If the request fails (for example, if the city is not found), the `error` state is set to `true`, and an error message is shown.

3. **Loading and Error Handling**:
   - **Loading Spinner**: While waiting for the weather data to be fetched, a spinner from the `react-loader-spinner` package (Vortex) is displayed.
   - **Error Message**: If the API returns an error (e.g., invalid city), an error message is displayed with a sad face icon using **FontAwesome**.

4. **Date Function (`toDateFunction`)**:
   - This function generates the current date in a readable format (e.g., "Monday 2 October"). It uses arrays of month and weekday names and returns a formatted string with the current date.

5. **Displaying Weather Information**:
   - If valid weather data is returned, it displays:
     - The city and country.
     - The current date.
     - The weather icon and temperature.
     - A description of the weather (e.g., "Clear Sky").
     - The wind speed.

### JSX Breakdown:
- **Search Input**: The user types the name of the city into the input field. When they press "Enter," the `search` function is triggered to fetch the weather data.
- **Loading Spinner**: The `Vortex` spinner appears when the `loading` state is `true`.
- **Error Message**: If the `error` state is `true`, an error message is shown indicating that the city was not found.
- **Weather Data Display**: When weather data is successfully fetched, the app displays:
  - City name and country code.
  - Current date.
  - An icon representing the weather (e.g., a sun for clear skies) and the temperature.
  - A brief weather description and wind speed.

### Example Flow:
1. The user types "New York" in the search input and presses "Enter."
2. The app makes a request to the OpenWeather API using the city name.
3. The app displays a loading spinner while waiting for the API response.
4. If the response is successful, the app displays the weather data for New York (temperature, description, etc.).
5. If the city is not found, the app shows an error message ("City not found").

### Summary:
This component lets users search for weather information by entering a city name. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve the current weather data and handles loading, error states, and data display. The user interface includes a loading spinner, an error message for invalid cities, and the weather details for valid searches.
