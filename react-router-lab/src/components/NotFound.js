/*Here's an explanation of the `NotFound` component:

### 1. **Component Structure:**
   - The `NotFound` component is a functional component in React that serves to inform users when they navigate to a route that does not exist. It is typically displayed when a user tries to access an invalid URL within the application.

### 2. **Return Statement:**
   - The component returns a JSX structure that will be rendered to the screen. Here's a breakdown of the returned elements:
     - **`<div className="not-found">`:** A container div that wraps the content of the component, styled with a CSS class named `"not-found"` to apply specific styles (not shown in this snippet).
     
     - **`<h2>404 - Not Found</h2>`:** An `<h2>` header that displays the status code "404," which is a standard HTTP status code indicating that the requested resource could not be found. This informs the user of the error.
     
     - **`<p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>`:** A paragraph providing a more descriptive message that clarifies to the user that the page they are trying to access is not available.
     
     - **`<a href="/" className="btn">Go Back Home</a>`:** An anchor (`<a>`) tag that serves as a button. It provides a way for the user to navigate back to the home page of the application. The `href="/"` attribute directs the user to the root of the application. The `className="btn"` is used to style this anchor tag to look like a button, based on the CSS rules associated with the `"btn"` class.

### 3. **Styling:**
   - The CSS class `not-found` is intended to apply styles specific to the Not Found page. Although the specific styles are not provided in this code snippet, they could include things like text alignment, font size, and background color to improve the user experience.

### 4. **Usage in the Application:**
   - The `NotFound` component would typically be used in the routing configuration of your application to handle cases where the user navigates to an undefined route. For example, in your `App.js`, you might have a route set up to display this component for any unmatched paths:
     ```javascript
     <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
     ```

### Summary:
This component serves as a user-friendly way to inform users that they have landed on a non-existent page, providing a clear message and an easy way to navigate back to the main part of the application. It enhances the overall user experience by helping users recover from navigation errors.*/
