/*Here's an explanation of the `DeletePerson` component:

### 1. **Component Structure:**
   - The `DeletePerson` component is a functional component in React that accepts two props:
     - `id`: The ID of the person to be deleted.
     - `onDelete`: A function passed as a prop that will handle the actual deletion of the person when invoked.

### 2. **handleDelete Function:**
   - The `handleDelete` function is called when the delete button is clicked.
   - Inside this function, the following steps occur:
     - It uses `window.confirm` to show a confirmation dialog to the user. The message `"Are you sure you want to delete this person?"` is displayed.
     - If the user clicks "OK" (which means they confirmed the action), the `onDelete` function is called, passing the `id` as an argument. This function is responsible for deleting the person with the given ID.

### 3. **Button Element:**
   - The `button` element renders a clickable button with the label "Delete."
   - The `onClick` event handler is attached to the button, which triggers the `handleDelete` function when clicked.
   - The button is styled with a CSS class `"btn btn-delete"`, which is expected to apply the delete button styles defined in your CSS.

### 4. **Usage of `onDelete`:**
   - The actual logic of deleting the person (like making an API call to delete from a server) is not handled within this component. Instead, the `onDelete` function passed from the parent component is responsible for that.
   - This makes the component reusable, allowing it to handle deletions based on the specific logic defined by the parent.

### Example Scenario:
   - If you have a list of people, each rendered with a `DeletePerson` component, clicking the "Delete" button will prompt the user with a confirmation message.
   - Upon confirmation, the parent component will handle the deletion logic, such as removing the person from the list or making a network request to delete the person from a database. 

This component is simple and focuses on user confirmation and delegating the deletion logic to the parent component.*/

/*Here's an explanation of the `NotFound` component:

### 1. **Component Structure:**
   - The `NotFound` component is a functional component in React that serves to inform users when they navigate to a route that does not exist. It is typically displayed when a user tries to access an invalid URL within the application.

### 2. **Return Statement:**
   - The component returns a JSX structure that will be rendered to the screen. Here's a breakdown of the returned elements:
     - **`<div className="not-found">`:** A container div that wraps the content of the component, styled with a CSS class named `"not-found"` to apply specific styles (not shown in this snippet).
     
     - **`<h2>404 - Not Found</h2>`:** An `<h2>` header that displays the status code "404," which is a standard HTTP status code indicating that the requested resource could not be found. This informs the user of the error.
     
     - **`<p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>`:** A paragraph providing a more descriptive message that clarifies to the user that the page they are trying to access is not available.
     
     - **`<a href="/" className="btn">Go Back Home</a>`:** An anchor (`<a>`) tag that serves as a button. It provides a way for the user to navigate back to the home page of the application. The `href="/"` attribute directs the user to the root of the application. The `className="btn"` is used to style this anchor tag to look like a button, based on the CSS rules associated with the `"btn"` class.

### 3. **Styling:**
   - The CSS class `not-found` is intended to apply styles specific to the Not Found page. Although the specific styles are not provided in this code snippet, they could include things like text alignment, font size, and background color to improve the user experience.

### 4. **Usage in the Application:**
   - The `NotFound` component would typically be used in the routing configuration of your application to handle cases where the user navigates to an undefined route. For example, in your `App.js`, you might have a route set up to display this component for any unmatched paths:
     ```javascript
     <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
     ```

### Summary:
This component serves as a user-friendly way to inform users that they have landed on a non-existent page, providing a clear message and an easy way to navigate back to the main part of the application. It enhances the overall user experience by helping users recover from navigation errors.*/

/*Here's an explanation of the `Notification` component:

### 1. **Component Structure:**
   - The `Notification` component is a functional component in React that is designed to display notifications to users. These notifications could be success messages, error alerts, or any informational messages that require user attention.

### 2. **Props:**
   - The component accepts two props:
     - **`message`:** An object that contains the notification text and type. 
       - `message.text`: A string that represents the content of the notification (what the notification will display).
       - `message.type`: A string that defines the type of notification (such as "success," "error," "warning," or "info"). This type can be used for styling purposes.
     - **`onClose`:** A function passed as a prop that will be called when the user wants to close the notification. This is typically used to remove the notification from the display.

### 3. **Dynamic Class Assignment:**
   - The variable `notificationClass` dynamically constructs the class name for the notification based on the `message.type`:
     ```javascript
     const notificationClass = `notification ${message.type}`;
     ```
   - This allows the component to apply different styles based on the notification type. For example, you might have different background colors or text colors for different types of notifications.

### 4. **Return Statement:**
   - The component returns a JSX structure that consists of:
     - **`<div className={notificationClass}>`:** A div that serves as the container for the notification. Its class name is set dynamically based on the `notificationClass` variable.
     - **`{message.text}`:** Displays the text content of the notification, allowing the user to read the message.
     - **`<button onClick={onClose} className="btn btn-cancel">Close</button>`:** A button that users can click to close the notification. When the button is clicked, the `onClose` function is called, allowing the parent component to handle the closing logic (like removing the notification from the UI). The button is styled with the classes `"btn"` and `"btn-cancel"`.

### 5. **Usage in the Application:**
   - The `Notification` component can be used anywhere in your application where you need to alert the user to certain events or actions. For example, after successfully adding or deleting a person, you might show a notification confirming the action.
   - It allows for a clean separation of the notification logic and display from the rest of the application logic, making it reusable and easier to manage.

### Summary:
The `Notification` component is a flexible and reusable piece of UI that allows you to display contextual messages to users. By accepting props for the message content and type, it can be styled and functionally customized to suit various needs in your application, enhancing user experience by providing timely feedback on actions.*/
