Here's a breakdown of your **`PersonList`** React component:

1. **Component Overview**:
   - This component displays a list of persons and allows users to add, edit, and delete persons. 
   - It uses **React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks** to manage state and side effects.
   - **Axios** is used to send HTTP requests to a server.

2. **Key Features**:
   - **Displaying Persons**: When the component loads, it fetches a list of persons from an API and displays them in a list.
   - **Adding a New Person**: Users can fill in a form with a person's name and age, then click "Add Person" to submit this info to the API.
   - **Editing a Person**: Each person has an "Edit" button. When clicked, it allows the user to update the person's information and submit the changes.
   - **Deleting a Person**: Each person also has a "Delete" button that removes them from the list and sends a delete request to the API.

3. **Hooks**:
   - **`useState`**: This hook is used to keep track of the list of persons, the new person form data, and the person being edited.
   - **`useEffect`**: This hook triggers the **fetchPersons** function to load the list of persons from the API when the component first appears on the screen.

4. **CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete):
   - **READ**: `fetchPersons` retrieves the list of persons from the server using `axios.get` and displays it.
   - **CREATE**: `addPerson` lets the user add a new person to the list by sending their data to the server using `axios.post`.
   - **UPDATE**: `updatePerson` allows a personâ€™s data to be updated when the user clicks "Edit", sends the updated data with `axios.put`.
   - **DELETE**: `deletePerson` removes a person from the list and deletes it on the server using `axios.delete`.

5. **Loading State**:
   - While the persons are being fetched, a loading message is shown.

6. **Forms**:
   - There are two forms:
     - One for adding a new person.
     - Another for editing a person's details (this only appears when the "Edit" button is clicked).

In summary, this component lets users manage a list of persons by adding, editing, and deleting them, with the data being stored on a server and updated in real-time on the screen using React state management.
