Here's an explanation of your **`App`** component:

### Overview:
This React component checks whether the entered password is "strong" based on specific criteria. It uses the **`validator`** library to perform the password validation.

### Key Features:
1. **Password Validation**:
   - The password is validated using the **`validator.isStrongPassword()`** function from the `validator` library.
   - A strong password is defined by these criteria:
     - Minimum length of 8 characters.
     - At least 1 lowercase letter.
     - At least 1 uppercase letter.
     - At least 1 number.
     - At least 1 symbol.

2. **State Management**:
   - `errorMessage`: This state variable stores a message indicating whether the password is strong or not.

3. **Validation Function (`validate`)**:
   - This function is called whenever the user types in the password input field.
   - It uses the `validator.isStrongPassword` function to check the strength of the entered password.
   - If the password meets the criteria, it updates `errorMessage` to "Is Strong Password."
   - Otherwise, it updates `errorMessage` to "Is Not Strong Password."

4. **Displaying the Validation Message**:
   - If `errorMessage` is not an empty string, the component displays the message ("Is Strong Password" or "Is Not Strong Password") below the input field.

### JSX Breakdown:
- **Input Field**: This is where the user types the password. The `onChange` event triggers the `validate` function each time the user types something.
- **Validation Message**: The message is displayed conditionally, based on the value of `errorMessage`. If no message is set (i.e., `errorMessage === ''`), nothing is displayed.

### Example Flow:
1. The user types a password into the input field.
2. As they type, the `validate` function checks whether the password meets the strong password criteria.
3. If the password is strong, the message "Is Strong Password" appears.
4. If the password is weak, the message "Is Not Strong Password" appears.

### Summary:
This component provides real-time feedback on password strength. It checks the entered password against predefined rules (length, upper/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) using the `validator` library, and displays a message to inform the user whether the password is strong or not.
